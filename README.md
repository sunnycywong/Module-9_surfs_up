## (2) Results                                                                           
The summary statistics of both June and December can only provide high level info about each month but are not good enough to provide a trend observation. Please see the following,


* One of the main factors is the total count in June is 1,700 and December is 1,517. Such a difference would cause a slight shift in the mean and standard deviation. From the current charts, we can see that their means and standard deviations are fairly near. However, if their total counts were the same, the differences in these numbers could show a bigger difference.

* Referring to the above, their percentiles would able to affectedby the total count number. Therefore, these numbers would not be as reliable forcomparison. 

* However, the data on lowest and highest temperatures are factual and would not be affected by the total count. Therefore, we could rely on the temperature differences here, where 83 to 85 degrees seem to be the highest temperature in the area, whereas the temperature could drop to as low as 56 degrees.
